\section{Limitations}
We could come up with the result that there is some locality in ripple transactions, unfortunately, our analysis is not really precise. It is hard to map a given wallet to a position in the world.
The limitations that stood in front of us where actually the protocol that is used by Ripple, since in the transaction data we only have a wallet identifier, no IP address or any information that could help us to link a wallet to a position. It is really hard to de-anonymize or get any personally identifiable information about the ripple wallets given how the transactions are propagated.
