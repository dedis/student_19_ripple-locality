\section{Further work}
To gain further information about localization of ripple transactions, it could be a good starting point to try to run rippled servers. As we explained in part 3.1.3, with good advertisement it might be possible to have clients connecting to those nodes. Running a gateway might also be good approach

In the analysis of the evolution of credit lines, we have found wallets that are not referenced as gateways in the API that appears as last hops of transactions. It could be a good idea to investigate further on those wallets they might turn out to be useful.

You can also read Listening to Whispers of Ripple: Linking Wallets and De-anonymizing Transactions in the Ripple Network by Pedro Moreno-Sanchez et al.\cite{ListeningtoWhispersofRipple} were they use different heuristics to gain information about wallet and transaction locality in Ripple.
