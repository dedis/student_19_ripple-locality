\section{Reproduce results}
Make sure you have anaconda \path{https://www.anaconda.com} installed to run the Jupyter Notebooks.
\vspace{\baselineskip}
You may want to install pip \path{https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/} to install the needed libraries easily.
Install the libraries from a terminal with:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{\$ pip install tqdm}
\item \texttt{\$ pip install python-ripple-lib}
\item \texttt{\$ pip install coinmarketcap}
\item \texttt{\$ pip install currencyconverter}
\end{itemize}

Install node.js \path{https://nodejs.org/en/download/} to run the javascript in the connect\_to\_nodes folder

Data is not uploaded to Github because it is too heavy. We have three original files situated in ripple\_analysis/data/transactions/original
\begin{itemize}
\item ripple-transactions-jan-2013-dec-2016.txt
\item more-txs-from-missing-parsed.txt
\item final\_txs\_2017.txt
\end{itemize}

We renamed \texttt{more-txs-from-missing-parsed.txt} to \texttt{more-txs-from-missing-parsed.json} and \texttt{final\_txs\_2017.txt} to \texttt{final\_txs\_2017.json}

\texttt{ripple-transactions-jan-2013-dec-2016.txt} is processed in \texttt{ripple-transactions-jan-2013-dec-2016.ipynb} situated in ripple\_analysis/notebooks
\vspace{\baselineskip}

The new files
\begin{itemize}
\item more-txs-from-missing-parsed.json
\item final\_txs\_2017.json
\item ripple-transactions-jan-2013-dec-2016.csv
\end{itemize}
are situated in ripple\_analysis/data/transactions

This folder connect\_to\_nodes contains the code used when we tried to connect to Ripple node
\begin{itemize}
\item get\_node\_urls is a jupyter notebook used to get the nodes url
\item get-server-info.js is a javascript file where we try to connect to nodes
\end{itemize}

From a terminal then go to the connect\_to\_nodes folder and you can run \texttt{node get-server-info.js}
\vspace{\baselineskip}

In the folder ripple\_analysis you will find the Jupyter Notebooks that gave use the graphs, open a terminal to the ripple\_analysis folder and then run \texttt{jupyter notebook} a new tab will open in your browser and you will be able to run the notebooks.
